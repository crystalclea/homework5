	<p2 style= "font-size:15px"> The year 2016 marks a drop in the number of AIDs cases reported as compared to the
		previous year - a relief to aids concern groups.
		<br> <br>
		Over the years, the number of HIV cases continued to rise. A total of 725 new cases of HIV infections were reported back in 2015, a 11.4 per 
		cent increase from the 651 in 2014.
		<br> <br>
		More than half of the new HIV infections in 2016 were contracted via homosexual intercourse, 
		mainly amongst young gay men, based on government statistics.
		<br> <br> 
		A significant portion of HIV-positive men had used drugs while engaging in sexual intercourse, 
		increasing the risk of unprotected sex, according to survey data obtained last year from patients 
		visiting specialist clinics.

	<p2 style="font-size:15px"> Men in general have more chance of getting HIV than women not because of being homosexual but having anal sex.
		<br> <br>
		It's been scientifically proven that anal sex is riskier than vaginal sex when it comes to HIV. 
		Eighteen times riskier to be exact. First, the cells in the butt are much more susceptible to HIV than cells in the 
		vagina. 
		<br> <br>
		Second, both semen and rectal mucosa (the lining of the ass) carry more HIV than vaginal fluid. 
		Combine this with the fact that gay and bi guys have much more anal sex than straight guys, 
		and youâ€™ve got yourself a lot more risk right there.</p2>

	According to the World Health Organisation, symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, 
		loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, dark-coloured urine and jaundice. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Not everyone will experience all symptoms.
	<br>
	<br>
	The Centre of Health Protection will from Friday provide free vaccinations to men 
		who are patients of the Integrated Treatment Centre, Aids Clinical Service of 
		Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Infectious Disease Special Medical Clinic of Princess Margaret 
		Hospital, Wan Chai Male Social Hygiene Clinic and Yau Ma Tei Male Social Hygiene Clinic. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Up to 1,800 men are expected to benefit to control the icrease of aids cases this year.
